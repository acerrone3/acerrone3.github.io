## GESTOFS-ML
This is a sister project of [GESTOFS](https://gm-ling.github.io/GESTOFS-develop/).  GESTOFS is an ADCIRC-based storm surge forecasting system for the whole globe.  GESTOFS-ML expands on this theme, but in place of ADCIRC, a time series forecasting ML model is employed complete with meteorological forcing to predict surface water elevation.
